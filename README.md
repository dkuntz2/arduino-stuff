# don's arduino stuff

i got really sick of using the arduino ide to do things so i put this together so i could just use my regular development toolkit (aka vim and the commandline).

## interesting stuff

all the _really_ interesting stuff is in `lib`, which is usually shared between projects.
the rest of the directories are projects, may or may not include a readme.
